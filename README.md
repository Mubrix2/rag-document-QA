# rag-document-QA


Document QA System using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Designed and implemented a document-aware question answering system using LangChain. The pipeline includes PDF ingestion, text chunking, embedding generation, vector storage, and context-aware LLM inference. The system reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved documents, showcasing applied RAG architecture for production-style LLM applications.
